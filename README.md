Gamepad Specification
---------------------

This repository is for editing drafts and discussion of the
[Gamepad](https://w3c.github.io/gamepad/) specification
(and [extensions](https://w3c.github.io/gamepad/extensions.html) to it).

Bugs for this specification now use Github Issues. Previously, [W3C's Bugzilla](https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/buglist.cgi?component=Gamepad&list_id=54698&product=WebAppsWG&resolution=---) 
was used for this spec's bug management.

See [FeatureRequests.md](FeatureRequests.md) for feature requests beyond the first version of this spec. 

This spec was started with W3C's Hg/Mercurial repository but work on
[that repository](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/gamepad/) has stopped.
